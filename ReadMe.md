This is a simple widged project, made in C++/WinRT, a clock, that I use pinned on my desktop, for educational purposes.

So, it runs on the Windows GameBar.

It can be an example on how to use the WinRT DispatcherTimer() with C++, how to implement the Timer event, and how to configure to be a GameBar application.

Is not fully ready and does not have configurations yet, and still have start menu entry and still runs on desktop.

Fell free to fork and comment about the code, as I'm learning, every help is useful.
